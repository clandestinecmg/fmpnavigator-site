      <p className="muted mb-6">
        FMP Navigator was founded by a medically-retired, disabled veteran living overseas who understands
        the challenges of accessing VA healthcare through the Foreign Medical Program (FMP) firsthand.
        Our mission is to make it easier for veterans abroad to find care, understand their benefits,
        and connect with trusted providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project operates out of Southeast Asia and collaborates with nonprofits and advocacy groups to
        improve transparency and access to care for veterans worldwide.
